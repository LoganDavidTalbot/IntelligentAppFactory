# AI Charters

An AI Charter is a document that outlines the principles and guidelines for AI use within an organization. It is developed collaboratively with employees and serves as a roadmap for how an organization or project plans to use or interact with AI technologies. The Charter acts as a constitution for AI, setting the stage for responsible and ethical AI usage. It reflects the unique culture, goals, and ethical considerations of the organization, and helps anticipate and mitigate potential risks associated with AI integration.

## Why Your Organization Needs an AI Charter

### Anticipating AI Adoption
Even if your organization has not yet adopted AI, creating an AI Charter can stimulate meaningful conversations about what AI integration could mean for your business. It's an engaging activity that can help you envision the future of your organization with AI.

### Establishing Principles and Values
Your AI Charter should be unique, reflecting your organization's distinct culture, goals, and ethical considerations. While there may be common elements like data privacy and security requirements, the Charter should be customized to your organization's specific needs and values.

### Mitigating Risks
AI integration can introduce unique risks, some of which you may not have anticipated. These could range from data security and privacy compliance issues, to ethical concerns about biased AI outputs, and potential legal risks related to intellectual property, such as copyright infringement. An AI Charter can help you foresee these challenges and devise strategies to mitigate them.

## Good example of AI Charters

=== "Microsoft"

    Microsoft's AI Charter is a great example. It outlines six principles that guide their use of AI:

    food production.
    3 Fair AI: produced by diverse teams using sound data for unbiased
    outcomes and the inclusion of all individuals and population groups.
    4. Transparent and explainable AI: with outcomes that can be
    understood, traced and audited, as appropriate.
    5. Controllable AI with clear accountability: enabling humans
    to make more informed choices and keep the last say.
    6. Robust and safe AI: including fallback plans where needed.
    7. AI respectful of privacy and data protection: considering
    data privacy and security from the design phase, for data usage that is
    secure, and legally compliant with privacy regulations.
