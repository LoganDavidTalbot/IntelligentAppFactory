Open source project to detail how cloud native intelligent app can be secured, developed, and architected at scale. Currently the focus is around Azure solutions but at a later date will be looking to expend to other hyper-scalers.

## :simple-target: Project Goals
- [x] Collecting information from across the internet and display in an easy to use way.
- [x] Focus from the point of view from the current Enterprise application developer. Scoped to the development & productionization of intelligent apps including prompting and fine-tuning of LLMs and the use of AI cloud services but not to training of new models.

## What is an Intelligent App (Cloud Native)?

A Intelligent App is a type of application that leverages the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and is designed to fully exploit the advantages of the cloud computing delivery model. These applications are built and hosted directly on the cloud and are designed to embrace rapid change, large scale, and resilience.

Intelligent Apps can adapt and learn from data inputs, improving their performance and accuracy over time. They can process vast amounts of data, identify patterns, make predictions, and even make decisions. This makes them particularly useful in scenarios where human-like cognition needs to be emulated or where decisions need to be made in real-time.

Examples of Intelligent Apps include recommendation systems, predictive analytics tools, natural language processing (NLP) systems, and many more. These applications are transforming industries by delivering enhanced customer experience, improving decision-making, and optimizing operations.

### Benefits of an Intelligent Application

Intelligent Applications offer numerous benefits, including:

- __Improved Decision Making__: By analyzing vast amounts of data and identifying patterns, Intelligent Apps can provide insights that help in making informed decisions.

- __Enhanced User Experience__: Intelligent Apps can personalize the user experience by understanding and predicting user behavior, leading to increased user satisfaction and engagement.

- __Increased Efficiency__: Through automation and optimization of processes, Intelligent Apps can significantly increase operational efficiency.

- __Scalability__: Being cloud-native, these applications can easily scale up or down based on demand, providing cost-effectiveness and flexibility.

- __Resilience__: Intelligent Apps are designed to be resilient and can handle failures without significant impact on the user experience or performance.

- __Continuous Learning and Adaptation__: Intelligent Apps learn from every interaction, improving their performance and accuracy over time.

### Cons of an Intelligent Application

Despite the numerous benefits, there are also some potential drawbacks to consider when developing an Intelligent Application:

- __Complexity__: The development and maintenance of Intelligent Apps can be complex due to the need for specialized knowledge in areas such as machine learning and data science.

- __Data Privacy__: Intelligent Apps often rely on large amounts of data, which can raise concerns about data privacy and security.

- __Dependence on Quality Data__: The performance of Intelligent Apps is heavily dependent on the quality of the data they are trained on. Poor quality data can lead to inaccurate predictions or decisions.

- __Cost__: While cloud-native applications can scale to reduce costs, the resources required for processing large amounts of data and running complex algorithms can be expensive.

- __Ethical Considerations__: The use of AI and machine learning can raise ethical questions, such as bias in decision-making processes and the potential for misuse of technology.
