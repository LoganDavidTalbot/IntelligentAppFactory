Open source project to detail how cloud native intelligent app can be secured, developed, and architected at scale. Currently the focus is around Azure solutions but at a later date will be looking to expend to other hyper-scalers.

- [x] Focus from the point of view from the current Enterprise application developer. Scoped to the development & productionization of intelligent apps including prompting and fine-tuning of LLMs and the use of AI cloud services but not to training of new models.
