# Productionizing Intelligent Apps

When evaluating Intelligent Apps it is common to do a proof of concept (PoC) which can be done fairly quickly. This can cause a common miss conception that Intelligent Apps are easy to build and can be ready to passed to users in production in a matter of days. This could not be further of the truth and in order to make intelligent application production ready you will need to consider these items:

1. Security - auth, networking, OWASP 10 top for AI, protecting applications from attack  etc.
1. Responsible AI - Guardrails
1. Reliability
1. Operational Excellence
1. Performance Efficiency
1. Cost Optimization
1. DevOps Capabilities  - technical, progress, & cultural e.g. LLMOps, versioning, CI/CD, automation, observability/ monitoring, continuous feedback, etc. 
1. Memory/ data management - knowledge mining, embeddings (vector databases), 
1. Evaluation & testing - both at the application and data level.
1. Organizations's criterial for production apps and use of AI.

Organizations can make this easier on development teams of Intelligent Apps by investing to platform engineering techniques that can lead a Internal Developer Platform (IDP) to produce better Intelligent Apps, faster.
