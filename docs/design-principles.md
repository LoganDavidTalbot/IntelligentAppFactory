# Design principles for Intelligent Applications

The design principles for intelligent applications are based on the [Well-Architected Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/), which provides a consistent approach for customers and partners to evaluate architectures and implement designs that will scale over time. The framework consists of a set of questions, known as the [pillars](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/pillars), which are designed to help you think about architectural decisions throughout the lifecycle of your projects. The framework also provides a set of [design principles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/design-principles) that are used to guide the decision-making process when designing and implementing solutions.
