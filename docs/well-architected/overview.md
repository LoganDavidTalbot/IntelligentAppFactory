# Productionizing Intelligent Apps

Evaluating Intelligent Apps, it is common to do a proof of concept (PoC) which can be done fairly quickly. This can cause a common miss conception that Intelligent Apps are easy to build and can be ready to passed to users in production in a matter of days. This could not be further of the truth and in order to make intelligent applications production ready you will need to consider these items which are modeled around cloud hyper-scalers Well-Architected Framework[^1] [^2] [^3].
