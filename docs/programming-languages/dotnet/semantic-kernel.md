# Semantic Kernel for .NET Intelligent Apps

![Semantic Kernel](../../images/logos/sk-logo.png){ align=left width=150 }

Semantic Kernel is an open-source Software Development Kit (SDK) that lets you easily build agents that can call your existing code. As a highly extensible SDK, you can use Semantic Kernel with models from OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Hugging Face, and more! By combining your existing C#, Python, and Java code with these models, you can build agents that answer questions and automate processes.
